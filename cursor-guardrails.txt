WORK RULES (strict):
- Repo: C:\Users\oscar\Documents\dev\optimandoai
- Only modify/create the files explicitly listed in the task.
- Do NOT touch: package.json, pnpm-lock.yaml, .github/**, tsconfig*, vitest.config.ts, build/CI configs.
- Do NOT add new dependencies.
- Minimal diff only. Do not rename public APIs/props/exports.
- No format-only changes; only what’s required for the task.
- Test env: Vitest + React Testing Library + jsdom + jest-dom are available.
- At the end, list the files you changed/created.
