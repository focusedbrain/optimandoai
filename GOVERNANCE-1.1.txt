1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE

This document defines the canonical governance and normative authority for the WR Code™ framework and its associated protocols.

It establishes:

the single source of truth for protocol correctness,

the distinction between public protocol specifications and proprietary framework components,

and the governance rules that prevent dilution, fragmentation, or hostile reinterpretation.

This document is normative.
All other documents are non-normative unless explicitly designated otherwise.

2. COVERED COMPONENTS

This governance applies to the following components:

2.1 Publicly Specified Protocols

BEAP™ — Bidirectional Email Automation Protocol

PoAE™— Proof of Authoritative Execution

These protocols are publicly specified but canonically governed.

2.2 Proprietary Framework Components

WR Code™ — Workflow Ready Code

WRGuard™

OpenGiraffe™


These components are proprietary and subject to separate licensing and trademark control.

3. CANONICAL AUTHORITY
3.1 Canon Definition

The Canon is the sole authoritative and normative definition of protocol behavior, semantics, terminology, and compliance requirements.

Paper v192, as designated by Optimando.ai, constitutes the initial canonical baseline.

3.2 Exclusivity

Only documents explicitly designated by Optimando.ai as canonical define:

correctness,

compliance,

and authoritative interpretation.

All other materials — including earlier papers, drafts, presentations, repositories, or derivative descriptions — are non-normative.

4. NORMATIVE VS. NON-NORMATIVE MATERIAL
4.1 Normative Material

This document

Canonical specifications explicitly designated by Optimando.ai

4.2 Non-Normative Material

Earlier papers and drafts

Explanatory or research texts

Blog posts, talks, examples, or summaries

Third-party interpretations or implementations

Non-normative material must not be used to claim protocol compliance or equivalence.

5. PROTOCOL INTEGRITY (BEAP™ & PoAE™)
5.1 Fixed Semantics

The normative semantics of BEAP™ and PoAE™ are fixed by the Canon.

Summaries, reformulations, alternative descriptions, or derivative explanations:

do not create normative status,

do not define compliance,

and must not be represented as authoritative.

5.2 Compliance Claims

An implementation may describe itself as BEAP™-compliant or PoAE™-compliant only if it conforms to the Canon.

Any deviation must be explicitly disclosed and must not be represented as compliant.

6. TERMINOLOGY AUTHORITY (PoAE™)

PoAE™ (Proof of Authoritative Execution) is the sole normative execution-proof concept within the Canon.

PoAE™ denotes execution that is:

cryptographically verifiable,

policy-bound,

and authorized according to canonical governance rules.

Generic terms such as “Proof of Execution (PoE)” are considered non-normative and carry no compliance meaning within this framework.

7. PROPRIETARY STATUS OF WR CODE™ FRAMEWORK
7.1 Ownership

The WR Code™ framework, including its architecture, runtime logic, orchestration model, and internal interfaces, is proprietary intellectual property of Optimando.ai.

7.2 Restricted Use

No third party is permitted to:

use the name “WR Code™”,

market a framework, runtime, or service under that name,

or present any product as an official WR Code™ implementation
without an explicit commercial or trademark license.

7.3 Implementations

Implementations of WR Code™ components (including WRGuard™ and OpenGiraffe™) are governed by separate licensing terms and are not granted by this document.

8. GOVERNANCE AND CONTROL

Optimando.ai retains exclusive authority over:

canonical designation,

normative interpretation,

versioning and evolution,

suspension or deprecation of prior materials,

and overall governance of the framework and protocols.

Publication of the Canon does not:

establish a community-governed standard,

transfer authority to third parties,

or permit hostile forks to claim equivalence.
