  "plainEnglishDescription": "This block displays code changes in a visual format, like what you see in GitHub pull requests. It shows what was deleted (in red with a minus sign) and what was added (in green with a plus sign). Each chunk of changes is called a 'hunk'. The block maintains the original code formatting and indentation. If enabled, it can also show icon-triggers next to each hunk, allowing users to click colored icons to analyze that specific code change. For example, clicking a blue icon next to a hunk could ask AI to explain why that change was made. This is useful for code review workflows where you want to examine changes piece by piece."
