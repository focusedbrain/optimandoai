📘 Paper Summary
This repository contains the original scientific paper and license documentation for **OpenGiraffe**, an innovative AI orchestration system published by **Optimando.ai**, a consulting firm specializing in AI automation workflows for enterprise and research applications.

📘 **Paper Summary**  
We introduce **OpenGiraffe**, a novel open-source framework that transforms browser tabs into collaborative AI agents using a master–helper orchestration model. The system provides forward-thinking, real-time, context-aware workflow suggestions by coordinating multiple language models across tabs—managed by a local orchestrator application. The entire architecture is client-side, open-source, and privacy-respecting.
