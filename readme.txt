# Open-Source Framework for Browser-Based AI Workflow Orchestration

This repository contains the original scientific paper published by [Optimando.ai](https://optimando.ai), an AI consulting company specialized in implementing intelligent automation workflows for enterprises.

## 📘 Paper Summary

We introduce a novel open-source framework that turns browser tabs into collaborative AI agents using a master–slave orchestration pattern. The system enables contextual, real-time optimization of digital workspaces by integrating multiple language models across browser tabs, coordinated by a central local orchestrator. It operates fully client-side, without cloud dependence.
