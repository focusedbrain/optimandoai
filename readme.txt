📁 Repository Overview

This repository contains the original scientific paper, documentation, and licensing files for WR Code, a browser-based AI orchestration system developed by Optimando.ai.
The system introduces a novel architecture for safe, local-first automation using Template-driven agents, tab-level context awareness, and a verifiable workflow ecosystem.

OpenGiraffe remains the internal codename for the core orchestration engine.
WR Code is the unified name of the overall framework and publishing standard.

📘 Paper Summary

The included research paper presents WR Code, an architecture that transforms browser environments into cooperative AI workspaces.
By using structured Templates (Mini-Apps), WRCode workflows, and a local orchestrator, the system coordinates distributed AI agents safely and contextually across tabs.

Key characteristics:

Local orchestrator 

Browser extensions for tab-level AI agents

Augmented Overlay for contextual UI insights

WRVault for secure local storage

WRGuard / WR MailGuard for mail & automation protection

Fully client-side, privacy-first architecture

No cloud dependency for core automation

The documentation describing these models is open-licensed; the runtime is not.

✔️ Transition Note

The framework originally launched as OpenGiraffe.
The modern standard consolidates naming under WR Code, while OpenGiraffe remains the internal codename for the orchestrator.
