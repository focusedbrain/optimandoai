Open-Source Framework for Browser-Based AI Workflow Orchestration (v10)
This repository contains the original scientific paper and license documentation for an innovative AI orchestration system published by Optimando.ai, a consulting firm specializing in AI automation workflows for enterprise and research applications.

📘 Paper Summary
We introduce a novel open-source framework that transforms browser tabs into collaborative AI agents using a master–helper orchestration model. The system provides real-time, context-aware workflow suggestions by coordinating multiple language models across tabs—managed by a local orchestrator app. The full architecture is client-side, open-source, and privacy-respecting.
