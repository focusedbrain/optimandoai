📁 WR Desk™ Framework & Canonical Specification
This repository contains the official Canonical Specification, normative documentation, and licensing for the WR Desk™ ecosystem, developed and maintained by Optimando.ai.

Optimando.ai is the publication identity and operating brand of
O.S. CyberEarth UG (haftungsbeschränkt).

📘 Paper v200: The Official Canon
The foundation of this repository is the cornerstone scientific and normative work: "WR Desk™ – Browser-Based Multi-Agent Orchestration for Contextual Workflow Automation" (v200).

Starting with v191, this document serves as the sole authoritative source (The Canon) for the following protocols:

WR Desk™ (Workflow Ready Desk): The unified framework and publishing standard for template-driven agent logic.

Wr Code™ (Workflow Ready Code): The unified Transport layer of Automation Workflows 

BEAP™ (Bidirectional Email Automation Protocol): The standard for secure, two-way automated workflow handling.

PoAE™ (Proof of Authoritative Execution): The cryptographic verification layer ensuring intent-bound execution.

🏛️ Normative Governance & Authority
The WR Code™ ecosystem operates under a Strict Governance Model to prevent protocol fragmentation and ensure the integrity of the standard:

Canonical Exclusivity: Only definitions provided in v191 (or subsequent versions explicitly designated by Optimando.ai) are recognized as Normative.

Governance Authority: All protocol semantics and compliance rules are managed exclusively by Optimando.ai. Third-party "forks" of the protocol logic are strictly prohibited from claiming compatibility or equivalence.

Suspension of Prior Versions: Paper v191 supersedes all previous drafts (v1–v190). All prior materials are now considered non-normative and suspended.

📜 Licensing (Proprietary Dual-Structure)

Read-Only/No-Derivatives: This specification is "open to be read, but closed to be redefined."

Protection of the Standard: Modification, translation, or creation of derivative specifications based on this Canon is strictly prohibited to prevent the dilution of the BEAP™ and PoAE™ standards.

2. Software Runtime License: OGPL-1.2
The functional software implementation (WR Desk™ framework, OpenGiraffe™ engine, WRGuard™, and WRVault™) is licensed under the OpenGiraffe Protected License (OGPL-1.2).

Source-Available (NOT Open-Source): Public redistribution, SaaS-hosting, or forking of the runtime is prohibited.

No AI Training: Use of this code for training machine learning models is strictly forbidden.

Template Freedom: Users retain the right to create, publish, and commercially distribute their own WR Code™ Templates.

🛡️ Brand & Trademark Protection
The following identifiers are protected trademarks of Optimando.ai: WR Desk™, WR Code™, BEAP™, PoAE™, WRGuard™, WRVault™, and OpenGiraffe™.

Use of these marks requires explicit authorization.

Implementations must strictly adhere to the Canon to use "Powered by WR Desk™" or "BEAP™-Certified" designations.

📝 Source Integrity (OpenTimestamps)
This repository utilizes OpenTimestamps (OTS) to provide immutable proof of provenance on the Bitcoin blockchain.

Verification: Every core file (PDF, License, Governance) has a corresponding .ots proof.

Audit Trail: This ensures that the establishment of the WR Desk™ Canon and its associated rights are cryptographically verifiable from the date of publication.

License Scope (Zenodo Snapshot)

This record contains Annex-2 and Annex-A1-v8 of the WRDesk™ specification.
Annex-2 and Annex-A1-v8 is licensed under the same license terms as WRDesk™, BEAP™, and PoAE™,
as defined in the primary WRDesk™ repository, including but not limited to
related annexes and normative documents forming part of the same system.
