A Source-Available License for Secure Local Automation Systems

© 2025 O.S. CyberEarth UG (haftungsbeschränkt). All rights reserved.

Optimando.ai is the publication identity and operating brand of
O.S. CyberEarth UG (haftungsbeschränkt).

1. Acceptance
By downloading, installing, or using the Software, you accept all terms of this License. If you do not agree, do not use the Software.

2. Definitions

“Software” means the WRDesk™ Orchestrator, including its automation kernel OpenGiraffe™,
local agent runtime, Augmented Overlay system, WRCode™ (Workflow-Ready Code)
integration layer, WR MailGuard™ mail and automation protection layer,
Proof of Authorized Execution (PoAE™) mechanisms,
the Bidirectional Email Automation Protocol (BEAP™),
all associated execution, authorization, security, and orchestration logic,
user interface components, and all files included in this distribution.

“Template” means a text-based instruction set interpreted by the Software, including Mini-Apps, workflows, overlay definitions, agent goals, and automation logic. Templates contain no executable code and include no protected components.

“Publisher” means O.S. CyberEarth UG (haftungsbeschränkt).

“User” means any individual or entity using the Software.

“Modification” means any change to the Software.

“Derived Work” means any altered, modified, or re-implemented version of internal components of the Software.

“Commercial Use” means any activity involving payment, revenue generation, invoicing, or integration into paid services or products.

3. License Grant
The Publisher grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to:
- View the Software’s source code
- Install and run the Software locally
- Create and use Templates (Mini-Apps, workflows, overlay text, WR MailGuard™ logic)
- Use the Software for personal, business, and cross-organizational workflows—including WRCode-based communication between different entities
- Local modifications are permitted solely for internal evaluation, testing, and research purposes. Such modified versions are considered non-canonical, unverified, and are explicitly excluded from enterprise-grade operation, security guarantees, integrity assurances, PoAE™ enforcement, and production use.

All rights not expressly granted are reserved.

4. Restrictions
Without explicit written permission from the Publisher, you may NOT:
- Redistribute the Software — No copying, publishing, uploading, packaging, mirroring, or distributing any part of it.
- Distribute Modified versions — Modifications may only be used internally and may not be published or shared.
- Create or publish competing platforms or runtimes, including: WRDesk™ orchestration engines, automation/workflow runtimes, Augmented Overlay runtimes, WRCode™ Workflow-Ready Code runtimes, BEAP™ and PoAE™ runtimes,  WR MailGuard™ protection flows, or agent execution layers.
- Provide the Software as a hosted or managed service — No SaaS, remote execution, cloud orchestration, or agent-as-a-service.
- Remove or obscure WRCode™ branding.
- Use the Software to train AI/ML models.
- Circumvent or tamper with protection mechanisms.

5. Template Rights (Mini-Apps)
You MAY create, publish, share, and sell Templates. Templates may express Mini-Apps, WRCode™ workflows, augmented overlay logic, agent instructions, website integrations, and more.

Templates may integrate with your own products or services.

Templates do NOT distribute the Software, because they contain no executable logic.

WRCode™ Templates must NOT:
- include Software code
- embed internal runtime behavior
- distribute protected components
- replicate or replace the Software
- act as a separate execution engine

WRCode™ Templates must remain pure text definitions interpreted by the Software.

6. No Distribution of Core Components
You may not distribute:
- the Software
- Modified versions
- internal libraries
- orchestration logic
- Augmented Overlay runtime
- WRGuard™ runtime or protection flows
- local agent runtime
- automation kernel
- WRDesk™ Workflow-Ready Desk modules
- or any identifiable runtime component

Only Templates may be distributed.

7. Intellectual Property

The Software and its architecture—including, without limitation,
the WRDesk™ Orchestrator, Augmented Overlay system,
WRCode™ Workflow-Ready Code integration, WRGuard™ security and enforcement components,
Proof of Authorized Execution (PoAE™), the Bidirectional Email Automation Protocol (BEAP™),
zero-trust local execution models, policy-bound execution and egress control,
dynamic template and capsule interpretation, automation engines,
and all associated UI, agent, and processing systems—
are exclusive intellectual property of the Publisher.

No ownership rights are transferred.

8. Termination
This License terminates automatically if you:
- redistribute the Software
- publish a fork
- build or attempt to build a competing runtime or automation platform
- provide the Software as a service
- embed protected components into Templates
- remove branding
- train AI/ML models using the Software
- bypass protection mechanisms
- violate any clause in this License

Upon termination, you must delete all copies of the Software.

9. Warranty Disclaimer
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

10. Limitation of Liability
